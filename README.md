# pipelinecreator - Plumber for the Luigi Framework
Graphical pipe line creator for luigi framework using NetworkX.


Let's be a plumber for the Luigi Framework pipelines (https://github.com/spotify/luigi).

The Luigi Framework gives a dependency graph as the graphical representation of pipeline designed directly in code (on web interface), however this graph is just to see the acomplishement and status of tasks that lies in pipeline.

Why not develop the graph in the beginning of the project to specify the pipeline that will be run, rather than develop directly in code?
